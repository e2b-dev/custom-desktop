## Under the hood

The desktop-like environment is based on Linux and [Xfce](https://www.xfce.org/) at the moment. We chose Xfce because it's a fast and lightweight environment that's also popular and actively supported. However, this Sandbox template is fully customizable and you can create your own desktop environment.
